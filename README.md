I hope mine makes you feel the same way. love your charming voice,cherry-like smile,eyes like deep ocean ,smile like blooming rose, attitude like soothing setting sunlight, conversation like bed of cherry blossoms, and you are be the only angel I could ever ask for🥰🥰.  All I just said is true to every extent of my existance.

  <p style="color:rgb(245, 210, 14)">Why are you so beautiful?🥰
Why do you take my breath away💘?
How are you perfect in every single way?
You're my sun on a cloudy day
You're my umbrella on a rainy day😍
You're in my mind each and everyday
You're the fallen angel I see🧚🏻‍♀️💃🏻
If you still don't believe..
That I'll always make you feel
The way you are now is more than
You are to be.❣️💖
